# Website Penetration Testing Toolkit

## Project Description

This project involves the development of a comprehensive Python-based toolkit designed for analyzing and performing penetration testing on websites. The toolkit will integrate widely-used open-source penetration testing tools as well as custom-written algorithms and functions, aiming to provide a powerful resource for security researchers and developers.

The tool will be used for testing websites either run locally or those that permit penetration testing via their design or bug bounty programs. The goal is to offer an easy-to-use interface for users to conduct various security assessments and vulnerabilities analysis.

## Features

- **Website Analysis**: Perform detailed analysis of website security, including identifying vulnerabilities like XSS, SQL Injection, and others.
- **Penetration Testing**: Automate penetration testing tasks and execute open-source penetration testing tools.
- **Custom Algorithms**: Develop custom-written security algorithms for enhanced analysis.
- **Local and Remote Testing**: Support for testing websites hosted locally or accessible via bug bounty programs.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provide an intuitive interface for easy interaction and output interpretation.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core language for developing the toolkit and its functionalities.
- **Open-Source Pen Testing Tools**: Integrating popular tools like OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, and others.
- **Web Technologies**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the front-end user interface.
- **Other Libraries**: Requests, BeautifulSoup, Selenium, etc.
